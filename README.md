My Python learning journey for data analytics

# Python Learning Journey 🐍

Hi! This repository documents my journey learning Python for data analytics.

I’m using small exercises and Google Colab notebooks to build:
- comfort with Python syntax
- intuition for data manipulation
- a foundation for SQL, Tableau, and data modeling work

This repo is intentionally simple and incremental.
Progress > perfection.
